\begin{prob}[3]
  Newton's Method with Equality Constraints: Consider the equality constrained
  entropy maximization problem
  \begin{eqnarray*}
    \mbox{minimize} & f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i} \log x_{i}\\
    \mbox{subject to} & Ax = b
  \end{eqnarray*}
  with $\mathbf{dom} f = \mathbf{R}^{n}_{++}$ and $A \in \mathbf{R}^{p \times n}$,
  with $p < n$.  Generate a problem instance with $n = 100$ and $p = 30$ by
  choosing $A$ randomly (checking that it has full rank), choosing $\hat{x}$
  as a random positive vector (e.g., with entries uniformly distributed on
  $\[0, 1\]$) and the setting $b = A \hat{x}$. (Thus, $\hat{x}$ is feasible).

  Compoute the solution of the problem using Infeasible start Newton Method.
  You can use initial point $x^{(0)} = \hat{x}$ (to compare with the standard
  Newton Method), and also the initial point $x^{(0)} = \mathbf{1}$.
